Notes
-----
For the conversion of the banner to an image, it's required that the images comes from the same origin. 

For local files, you can use a local web server. For example:

    python -m http.server
    
For images from a different host, one possiblity is to use a proxy web. There is a hook to convert the image urls to another one proxified. The option `imageUrlHook` in the
 settings of BannerDesigner class could be a template url containing the placeholder '{url}' for the replacement of the url intended to proxify (for example in the query string), or a function making the conversion to the proxified url.
